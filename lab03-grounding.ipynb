    "# Grounding with Bing\n",
    "**Grounding with Bing Search** allows your Azure AI Agents to incorporate real-time public web data when generating responses. You need to create a Grounding with Bing Search resource, and then connect this resource to your Azure AI Agents. When a user sends a query, Azure AI Agents decide if Grounding with Bing Search should be leveraged or not. If so, it will leverage Bing to search over public web data and return relevant chunks. Lastly, Azure AI Agents will use returned chunks to generate a response.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can ask questions such as \"*what is the top news today*\" or \"*what is the recent update in the retail industry in the US?*\", which require real-time public data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers and end users don't have access to raw content returned from Grounding with Bing Search. The response, however, includes citations with links to the websites used to generate the response, and a link to the Bing query used for the search. These two *References* must be retained and displayed in the exact form provided by Microsoft, as per Grounding with Bing Search's [Use and Display Requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/grounding-legal#use-and-display-requirements). See the [how to display Grounding with Bing Search results](#how-to-display-grounding-with-bing-search-results) section for details.\n",

    ">[!IMPORTANT]\n",
    "> 1. Your usage of Grounding with Bing Search may incur costs. See the [pricing page](https://www.microsoft.com/bing/apis/grounding-pricing) for details.\n",
    "> 1. By creating and using a Grounding with Bing Search resource through code-first experience, such as Azure CLI, or deploying through deployment template, you agree to be bound by and comply with the terms available at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/grounding-legal, which may be updated from time to time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Setup:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "> [!NOTE]\n",
    "> 1. Grounding with Bing Search only works with the following Azure OpenAI models: `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`, `gpt-4-0125-preview`, `gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09`, `gpt-4o-0513`\n",

    "   ```console\n",
    "       az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Bing'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new Grounding with Bing Search resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.BingGroundingSearch), and select the different fields in the creation form. Make sure you create this Grounding with Bing Search resource in the same resource group as your Azure AI Agent, AI Project, and other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After you have created a Grounding with Bing Search resource, you can find it in [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home). Navigate to the resource group you've created the resource in, search for the Grounding with Bing Search resource you have created.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ![alt text](assets/img/resource-azure-portal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the Grounding with Bing Search resource you have created and copy any of the API keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![alt text](assets/img/key-resource-azure-portal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/) and select the AI Project (make sure it's in the same resource group of your Grounding with Bing Search resource). Click **management center**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![alt text](assets/img/project-settings-button.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select **+ new connection** in the settings page. \n",
    "\n",
    "    >[!NOTE]\n",
    "    > If you re-generate the API key at a later date, you need to update the connection with the new key.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Select **API key** in **other resource types**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![alt text](assets/img/api-key-connection.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enter the following information and then create a new connection to your Grounding with Bing Search resource.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have configured everything, let's create a client object, which will contain the connection string for connecting to your AI project and other resources. To make the Grounding with Bing search tool available to your agent, use a connection to initialize the tool and attach it to the agent.

    "> **Important Considerations:** \n",
    ">    * According to Grounding with Bing's [terms of use and use and display requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/grounding-legal#use-and-display-requirements), you need to display both website URLs and Bing search query URLs in your custom interface. You can find website URLs through `annotations` parameter in API response and Bing search query URLs through `runstep` details. To render the webpage, we recommend you replace the endpoint of Bing search query URLs with `www.bing.com` and your Bing search query URL would look like \"https://www.bing.com/search?q={search query}\"\n",
